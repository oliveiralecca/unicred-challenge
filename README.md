## :dart: About ##

The goal of this project was to do a CRUD just in the front-end application layer. To do this some technologies were used like React Context API to centralize the data management and the browser Local Storage to persist them. Other techs were used for the project style and structure like Styled Components and TypeScript. The React Hook Form library was used to facilitate the form construction and manipulation and the ESLint was used to maintain the pattern of code coherent.
